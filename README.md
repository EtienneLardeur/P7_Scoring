# Introduction

Our notebooks have been initialized thanks to several sources provided around the Home Credit default risk [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk) competition: data from Home Credit, Kernels-Notebooks from competitors, Discussions threads involving host and competitors.

While the objective of competitors is to get the best AUC score _Area under the ROC Curve_ by *__any means__*, we'll rather focuse on the ability to provide *__interpretable__* decisions, including the possibility given to customers to explore their case.
